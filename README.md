# e-commerce-ts

**Work in progress!**

This time ecommerce project. This will be a simple shop app with implementation of payments (stripe). The project is
based on this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=377AQ0y6LPA), but with a small twist - I'm implementing
this project in typescript. 

## Installation

1. Go to the main folder and install all dependencies by `npm i` & `npm i -D`.
2. Then run `npm start` and checkout the [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser.
